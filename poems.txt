-- Wanderer

Don't worry, I'll come for you,
As you go away with the winds,
in the sky up through the brink

I am a Wanderer,
Searching you in the Woods of Happiness,
                    Sky of Calmness,
                    and Sea of Joy

I am a Wanderer, 
Even walking when there's no one behind.
Seeing Everything that'll turn me blind.

I am a Wanderer,
I don't know the haven that I have to go,
Still I'm walking the longest lengths I know.

I am a Wanderer,
I'd climb up the tallest heights,
If I can find you there.

I am a Wanderer,
Doesn't matter how long will it take,
I got opulence of time.

I am a Wanderer,
I won't stop where the land goes off
and the Seas come aligned.

I am a Wanderer,
I'd better be a walking dead,
than a stalling alive.

I am a Wanderer,
I'll knock at garden of wonders,
to look you around.

Oh darling, 
But those flowers seem not as fragrant
Those sunsets seem not as calming
That sun seems not as bright
That moon seems not as gleaming
Those gardens seem not as vivid
That cascade seems not as soothing
Since I saw your eyes 

-- In what way?

You said " I want you"
In what way? 
-
Well, every way that's possible
Every way that brings us closer 
Every way that strengthens our lovely bond
Every way that entangles our souls more
Every way that makes you more mine, and me more yours
Every way that allows me to look into your beautiful eyes
Every way that ables me to cherish that sweet voice
Every way that makes me love you more each time i think of you
And Every way that makes me think of you more

--

You are the sunshine to the shadow of my days. 
You are the moonlight to the glitter of my nights. 
Wish you were with me when I see the sun rise. 
And you were here to adore the sunset, 
While I charm about the lucky day we met. 

--

The Enchanted flora pulled me close,
Smelled so lovely it blesses my nose
Trapped I was in the enticing sphere
Had No Clue to move where
So, I stayed with the flowers
Cherishing the lure and power
Anyawy, I felt better stuck
Than in this vicious world
Sparing my luck

-- 

Oh darling, 
But the Sun envied your glow
and the stars feared your brilliance
