Oh darling, 
But those flowers seem not as fragrant
Those sunsets seem not as calming
That sun seems not as bright
That moon seems not as gleaming
Those gardens seem not as vivid
That cascade seems not as soothing
Since I saw your eyes </pre>

The Enchanted flora pulled me close,
Smelled so lovely it blesses my nose
Trapped I was in the enticing sphere
Had No Clue to move where
So, I stayed with the flowers
Cherishing the lure and power
Anyawy, I felt better stuck
Than in this vicious world
Sparing my luck. </pre>

You said " I want you"
In what way? 
-
Well, every way that's possible
Every way that brings us closer 
Every way that strengthens our lovely bond
Every way that entangles our souls more
Every way that makes you more mine, and me more yours
Every way that allows me to look into your beautiful eyes
Every way that ables me to cherish that sweet voice
<b>Every way that makes me love you more each time i think of you
And Every way that makes me think of you more.</b> </pre>
