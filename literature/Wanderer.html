        <pre>
Don't worry, I'll come for you,
As you go away with the winds,
in the sky up through the brink

I am a Wanderer,
Searching you in the Woods of Happiness,
Sky of Calmness, and Sea of Joy

I am a Wanderer, 
Even walking when there's no one behind.
Seeing Everything that'll make me blind.

I am a Wanderer,
I don't know the haven that I have to go,
Still, I'm walking the longest lengths I know.

I am a Wanderer,
I'd climb up the tallest heights,
If I can find you there.

I am a Wanderer,
Doesn't matter how long will it take,
I got opulence of time.

I am a Wanderer,
I won't stop where the land goes off
and the Seas come aligned.

I am a Wanderer,
I'd better be a walking dead,
than a stalling alive.

I am a Wanderer.</pre>
